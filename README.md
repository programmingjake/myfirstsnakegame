My first Python game
Created in Pycharm and I did get help. The changes I made from the original code was changing the colors and understanding what worked and what doesnt work. Example is that if I wanted multiple ways to control in the game, with arrowkeys and wasd then the game would crash. 
Maybe someone can add that to this game. Feel free to use this code.
